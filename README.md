###### I do not have a favorite band, but I really like Hans Zimmer

-----
I like him because his music sounds very **strong** and emotional, especially in movies. His music makes scenes feel more serious and exciting, even without people talking. I also like how his music creates **suspense** and keeps me interested. Sometimes I listen to his music while studying because it helps me focus.
